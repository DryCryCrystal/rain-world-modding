<body><h1>Adding A New Region</h1>
<h2><strong><em><u>This article is outdated and needs updating!</u></em></strong></h2>
<p>## </p>
<ol start='' >
<li>Pick a two letter acronym for your region. For these examples we&#39;ll use XX</li>
<li>Open the file &quot;Rain World/World/Regions/regions.txt&quot;</li>
<li>Add your two letter acronym to the end of the file.</li>
<li>Create a new folder in the Regions directory with your two letter acronym</li>
<li>Copy files over from one of the other regions to use as a template</li>
<li>Rename instances of the old region&#39;s acronym to your new region&#39;s acronym</li>

</ol>
<p>  6a. I recommend blanking out the map_XX file entirely</p>
<p>  6b. Remove all Room_Attr lines from the Properties file</p>
<p>  6c. Delete everything from the Rooms folder, leaving just one room to use as your start map to build off of.</p>
<p>  6d. Blank out most of the ROOMS and CREATURES sections from the world_XX file.
  		- If you want Vultures/Leviathans/Scavengers in your region, leave the OFFSCREEN section under CREATURES
  		- You&#39;ll add a couple lines under ROOM for connecting the gate and your start room, so your region at least has SOMETHING in it (once you make the gate).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding the Gate</h2>
<hr />
<ol start='' >
<li>Go to the &quot;Rain World/World/Gates&quot; folder</li>
<li>Take one of the gates in here to use as a base, and copy/paste it</li>
<li>Rename the copies to match your region connection. For example, if you&#39;re connecting to SU, name the files GATE_SU_XX</li>
<li>You&#39;ll also need to open the GATE_YY_XX.txt file and edit the first line of the file to match</li>
<li>Open the file &quot;Rain World/World/Gates/locks.txt&quot;</li>
<li>Add a new line for your new gate, and specify the karma requirements for the two sides of the gate</li>
<li>Go back to each of the two regions and add connections to the gate in their world_XX.txt files</li>

</ol>
