# Rain World Modding Wiki Dump

A repository for proper collaboration on the [RW Modding wiki](https://rain-world-modding.fandom.com/wiki/Rain_World_Modding_Wiki).

## Why?
Because the modding wiki has largely fallen into disuse and some pages haven't been updated in upwards of 2 years. 
The modding community has been active in the sanctuary of the Rain World Discord's modding channels and some offshoots for large RW expansions, 
but appears abandoned from the outside. It's time to rectify this.
